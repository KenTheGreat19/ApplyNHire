Your PNG logo is installed as `public/logo.png` and is now used in the site header.

Details:
- The header now references `/logo.png` (see `components/Header.tsx`).
- The placeholder SVG (`public/logo.svg`) has been removed.

If you want the header to use a different file name or size, tell me and I will update `components/Header.tsx` accordingly.
